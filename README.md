==========================
# Heroku Buildpack for Steller Logstash

This buildpack sets up a basic environment to run Steller Logstash in. It is not a general purpose
buildback in that it is designed to run a logstash 1.4.0 release that contains a custom s3.rb output patch.

This is the config used by the steller-logstash repo :)
